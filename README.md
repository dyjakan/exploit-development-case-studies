# Exploit Development: Case Studies

This repository is intended as a personal list of exploit development case studies I stumble upon during my work. My categorization is not very granular â€” I'm skipping differentiation between user-mode and kernel-mode, as well as type of the software being exploited. Exploit primitives are what's really important, therefore the only two categories I'm using are *Windows* and *Unix-like* (including Linux, Android, MacOS, iOS, BSDs, _et cetera_).
